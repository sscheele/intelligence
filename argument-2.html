          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First things first, we&rsquo;ll have to refute a few arguments about the nature of reality and ethics. </span></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong><strong><em>Perception is reality.</em></strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to refute this, we&rsquo;ll have to pose a certain question: Is there such a thing as objective truth? We offer a proof by contradiction: assume that there is no such thing as objective truth. The problem with this is that the statement is logically inconsistent. The statement &ldquo;There is no such thing as an objective truth&rdquo; is in itself an objective truth. Even subjectively, a single claim cannot be both true and false. Even so, if the statement &ldquo;There is no objective truth&rdquo; is subjectively true for some people, and subjectively false for others, then the objectivity of truth will win over, because of the nature of objectivity: </span><strong>If an objective truth comes into conflict with a subjective truth, then the subjective truth is false. </strong>
              <span
                style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s simply due to the definition of objective truth: it is always true. This means, then, that because
                objective truth exists, it must have somewhere to reside beyond the subjective realm. This is what we call
                reality. People that believe in a subjective nature of reality are called </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">naive realists</span></em>
                <span
                  style="font-weight: 400;">. And, &ldquo;In information philosophy terms, naive realism mistakenly assumes that the information in the
                  perceived sense data (or the representation in the mind) is (quantitatively) </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">equal to</span></em>
                  <span
                    style="font-weight: 400;"> (a copy of) the information in the physical object&rdquo; (</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information Philosopher</span></em>
                    <span
                      style="font-weight: 400;">). Basically, this means that people who believe in a subjective nature of reality mistake individual
                      experience of reality as the real thing. Unfortunately, because of what has been said above, this is
                      not true.&nbsp;Humanity has recognized for thousands of years that reality (at least on our scale)
                      is objective, and that we are ill-equipped to perceive it. Numerous experiments have verified this
                      fact. In one experiment, researchers played either happy music, scary music, or no music while showing
                      subjects a neutral image which could be interpreted as either threatening or non-threatening (for instance,
                      one image might look like either a coiled rope or a snake). They found that the scarier music more
                      than doubled the proportion of subjects who saw the threat (Wright). In another, participants who had
                      just watched a scary movie consistently interpreted the facial expressions of strangers, particularly
                      those belonging to other ethnic groups, as more menacing than their peers who had not seen the movie
                      (Wright). Experiments on subjects whose <em>corpora callosa</em> had been severed have yielded results
                      that may suggest that consciousness is itself an illusion (Wright).</span>
                      </strong>
            </li>
            <li><strong><strong><em>Ethics is subjective. </em></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ends of ethics are to come to an understanding of what is objectively good. When someone makes a moral statement, they are stating &ldquo;X is good&rdquo;. As a claim, that statement can only be objectively true or false. Approaching ethics subjectively effectively trivializes ethical theory, because if taken as such, a philosopher can simply conjure a situation in which the same action is moral or immoral whenever they please. </span><strong>A useful ethical system holds up universally, not locally</strong>
              <span
                style="font-weight: 400;">. Thus, ethics in this essay will be treated as a scientific endeavor: an attempt to apply an objective set
                of underlying principles, and therefore objective in an of itself.</span>
                </strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><br /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like axioms in mathematics, these assumptions lay the groundwork for a philosophical system by which to argue logically valid statements. While you may choose to effectively </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">know</span></em>
            <span
              style="font-weight: 400;"> nothing (it&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad idea, Socrates claimed he knew nothing and was considered one of the
              smartest men alive), some assumptions eventually must be made to get anywhere with any form of inquiry.</span>
