          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood Music</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the noocytes evolve in their levels of information processing. As simple cells, they are first level processors. As enhanced lymphocytes, they move into the second level, and quickly evolve into the third level as developing noocytes. It&rsquo;s difficult to say whether they are second or third-level processors in Vergil&rsquo;s lab, but we know that over the course of a few months, they learn to navigate &ldquo;complex mazes at rates&hellip; comparable to mice&rdquo; (Bear 19). Then, as they take over the biosphere and build a sense of community, it becomes evident that they move into the fourth. Bear makes a point of putting this sense of community on display when he describes Bernard&rsquo;s experience as a noocyte - he is &ldquo;an integral part, in turn loved and necessary&rdquo; (Bear 213).</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what actions can we take against them? Moreover, what rights were taken against them that were justified or not?</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that, at levels 1 and 2, the noocytes have no concept of freedom, Virgil&rsquo;s incubation of them is morally permissible. In fact, it allows for them to evolve, and acquire information. However, when he destroys them, he is behaving immorally, as he is destroying information structures. But given that he has little choice in the matter, he can be argued to be less than entirely culpable. </span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edward&rsquo;s choice to kill Vergil and the noocytes was clearly murder. However, it may have been justified. One could argue that what Edward did was to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">preserve </span></em>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">information, that of humanity. However, Edward couldn&rsquo;t have known what consequences his action (or inaction)
              would have, as he did not have any information about the noocyte&rsquo;s intentions. So while Edward&rsquo;s
              genocide may not have been immoral, it was at the very least misguided.</span>
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about the noocytes? It is unclear if they had a sense of morality during the process of assimilation, but they certainly developed one. In fact, their reverence of ancestor cells is very reminiscent of information philosophy. However, their &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; did destroy information. Therefore, whether or not they are to be held morally responsible for these deaths depends on whether they had at that point developed a sense of community and morality. Certainly, they had some form of government and specialization, since Vergil refers early on to &ldquo;researchers&rdquo; (Bear 77) and an &ldquo;absolute hierarchy&rdquo; (Bear 80). However, there is no evidence that they had any concept of morality at this point.</span></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">2001: A Space Odyssey</span></em>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">, the main conflict occurs between a killer AI named HAL 9000 and an astronaut named David Bowman. For reasons
              unknown, HAL decides that it is best for the mission for it to act of its own accord, and proceeds to murder
              the crew when it detects that they may prevent him from completing his task. Can HAL be held morally responsible
              for this? Unfortunately not. HAL does not display any signs of morality, simply that of the ability to predict
              the future. Therefore he is in level 3 of information processing. </span>
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, are </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dave&rsquo;s</span></em>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;"> actions immoral? In order to protect himself, Dave must essentially kill HAL, by unplugging the memory banks
              that make up HAL&rsquo;s consciousness. The answer lies in what HAL&rsquo;s intentions were. Dave was simply
              protecting </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">his</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> right to life. As it so happens, one has a greater right to protect one&rsquo;s fundamental right to life than a moral responsibility to anothers&rsquo;. Please listen to our conclusions on HAL and the noocytes below.</span></p>
